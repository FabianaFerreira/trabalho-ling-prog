Tom: G#
Intro: G# C# D# G# C# D#
G#              C#     D# 
I've kissed the moon a million times
G#          C#         D#
Danced with angels in the sky 
G#          C#             D#
I've seen snowfall in the summertime
G#        C#            D#
Felt the healing of the powers above
G#            C#             D#
I've seen the world from the highest mountain
G#          C#              D#
Tasted love from the purest fountain 
G#        C#              D#
I've seen lips that spark desire
G#       C#            D#
Felt the butterflies a hundred times
Fm             C#
I've even seen miracles 
G#                  D#
I've felt the pain disappear
    Fm                 C#
But still haven't seen anything
G#                            C#
That amazes me quite like you do
G#                   C#
You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
A#m                   D#
You touch me deep you touch me right 
G#                     C#

Cause baby, you're my number one
B    C#m           F#
Naveguei ventos de emoções
B      C#m          F#
eu vi a lua se entregar ao mar
B     C#m           F#
Troquei mistérios no amanhecer
B     C#m       F#
Entre os anjos e você
G#m         C#m
Já vi tudo acontecer
   B               F# 
Milagres tornados reais
G#m            C#m 
Mas nunca eu vi nada assim
         B                    F#
Quando os teus olhos olham pra mim
