Tom: G

We talked about Bm making it
          F#7
I'm sorry that you never made it
       G7                           F#7
And it pains me to hear you have to say it
                      Bm
You knew the game and played it
                         F#7
It kills me to know that you have been defeated
  G7                                 F#7
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
                   Bm                        F#7
You knew you had a reason it killed you like diseases
                        G7                         F#7
I could hear it in your voice while you're speaking
                     Bm                 F#7
He can't be treated, Mr.-Know-It-All had his reign, and his fall 

At least that is what his brain is telling all

                             Bm      F#7
If he said, help me kill the president

                 G7      F#7
I'd say he needs medicine,
                  Bm       F#7
Sick of screaming let us in
                  G7
The wires got the best of him,
    B                        Bm
and all that he invested in, goes
            F#7               G7     B         Bm
Straight to hell, Straight to hell, (woah oh oh)
            F#7               G7
Straight to hell, straight to hell
