Tom: D

     C         Am          Em                  G
When I wake up I'm afraid, somebody else might take my place
     C         Am          Em                  G
When I wake up I'm afraid, somebody else might take my place

C                Am               Em             G
Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
       C              Am     Em      G
On the fence, all the time
C                  Am             Em                G
Paint young honey, face so sunny, ain't that funny
       C              Am     Em
All my friends always lie to me
G
I know they're thinking

C                Am          Em    G
You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway
C           Am      Em          G
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
C              Am    Em         G
It hurts but I won't fight you, you suck anyway

C           Am         Em    G
You make me wanna die, right when I

     C         Am          Em                  G

     C         Am          Em                  G
When I wake up I'm afraid, somebody else might end up being me

C                 Am                 Em                   G
Keep on dreaming, don't stop giving, fight those demons
          C              Am    Em    G
Sell your soul, not your whole self
C               Am                    Em                  G
If they see you when you're sleeping, make them leave it
                 C               Am       Em   G
And I can't even see if it's all there anymore so

C                Am           Em   G
You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway
C        Am       Em            G
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
C            Am      Em         G
It hurts but I won't fight you, you suck anyway
C           Am         Em    G
You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up I'm afraid, somebody else might end up being me

C            Am
Being me and only me
Em                G
Feeling scared to breathe
C            Am              Em        G
If you leave me then I'll be afraid of everything
              C                 Am                 Em    G
That makes me anxious, gives me patience, calms me down
       C                 Am                Em
Let me face this, let me sleep, and when I wake up
G~
Let me breathe

     C         Am          Em                  G
